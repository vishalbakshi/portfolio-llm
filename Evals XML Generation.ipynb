His source data (fastbook textbook) is simple structured: explanatory text, some images and code blocks in a Jupyter Notebook. A real-world product might have different data formats to handle. fastbook is narrow in scope: all documents are focused on different aspects of learning machine learning. A real-world product might have different aspects of a more complex domain like law or medicine. fastbook-benchmark is small (191 QA pairs): a real-world product might have thousands or millions of dataset items.\\n\\nHe would address scale and scope with pre-processing the data and adding metadata to the document collection to allow the retrieval/search to identify the appropriate document given a query. He would also perform multi-modal retrieval if applicable as recent research (CLaMR by Wan, et al) shows that multi-modal retrieval outperforms single modality retrieval. Scale would affect both storage/indexing size and time as well as search time. He would implement the recent LightOnAI FastPlaid indexing implementation and AnswerAI's FastKmeans to address speed and/or implement StanfordNLP's ColBERT implementation to address RAM usage. A number of open source implementations (RAGatouille, ColBERT, PyLate) perform search quickly.
