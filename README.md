# portfolio-llm

This is a work in progress. I plan to launch it with a video and blog post by 7/1/2025.

An engineered professional portfolio designed to be reliably queried by an LLM. This project uses a curated context file (llms_ctx.txt) and a rigorous evaluation framework to provide an accurate and interactive overview of my skills and experience.

A potential next step for this project is to wrap it in a dedicated FastHTML application to provide a fully controlled and guided user experience.
