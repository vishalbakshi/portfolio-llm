### An Interactive Way to Learn About My Work

This portfolio is designed to be interactive. You can have a conversation with it using any modern LLM (like Gemini, Claude, or ChatGPT).

How it Works:

1. Copy my [portfolio llms_ctx.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vishalbakshi/portfolio-llm/refs/heads/main/llms_ctx.txt)
2. Go to your favorite LLM and paste the following prompt followed by the llms_ctx.txt content:

```
I'm going to give you a block of text that is a professional portfolio for Vishal Bakshi.

After you read it, I will ask you some questions.

Please base all of your answers only on the text I've provided and don't use any of your outside knowledge.

If you can't find an answer in the text, it's important that you say the information is not available.

Here is the text:
```
  
4. Start asking questions! For example: "Who is Vishal?" or "What are his main projects?"

#### For a Deeper Dive

Below are the core themes that structure my work. Use these to ask more specific questions, such as "Tell me about the 'Building Evaluation Infrastructure' theme."
