## Portfolio Deep Dive Q&A

**Question:** Explain his "Building Reliable Systems" philosophy. How did his work in data compliance inform this approach?

**Answer:** His philosophy for "Building Reliable Systems" has two parts: first, focusing on reliability from day one, and second, establishing robust processes so reliability isn't a single point of failure.

His seven years in data compliance taught him this firsthand. To ensure error-free state and federal reporting, he had to build a complete system—from initial metric design and data collection to ongoing QA and user training. He had to anticipate user pain points and build a process that made it easy for them to succeed.

He approaches his AI projects the same way. He starts with evaluations to define success, performs granular analysis early to understand failure modes, and then establishes a routine evaluation cadence. He's even applying this to his applied AI career by taking the AI Evals course with Hamel Husain, ensuring he solidifies the principles of rigor and evaluation before he focuses on anything else.

---

**Question:** He mentions the "Narrow Fence, Long Leash" philosophy. How does his TinyScale Lab project represent a "Long Leash" for his "Narrow Fence" project, AgentFastbook?

**Answer:** His AgentFastbook project is his "Narrow Fence": a concrete, applied AI system with a clear goal (construct a QA dataset). To ensure he can explore fundamental research without getting sidetracked, he uses TinyScaleLab as his "Long Leash" to directly inform the later, more ambitious phases of AgentFastbook. Phase 1 of AgentFastbook is purely applied AI---he uses an existing LLM (currently Haiku-3.5) to decompose the gold standard answer into answer components, an existing retriever (answerai-colbert-small-v1) to retrieve relevant passages for each answer component and an existing LLM to extract relevant text from those passages as gold standard context. Phase 2 will involve replacing the LLM (decomposition and extraction) with existing TinyStories models (from the TinyStories paper author) with continued pretraining on Wikipedia and then domain-specific finetuning on existing fastbook-benchmark data.  Phase 3 will replace these tiny models with from-scratch pretrained versions. TinyScaleLab (pretraining highly performant tiny models from scratch) will drive Phases 2 and 3.

---

**Question:** In his "Finding My Moat" video, he talks about the importance of "boring" tasks. What is the most "boring" but critical part of a project he's built?

**Answer:** For TinyScaleLab he manually scored 450 stories, then manually scored agreement with 1350 LLM Judge scores, both which allowed him to identify common failure modes and gain confidence in using his LLM Judge. For fastbook-benchmark: manually retrieving context from chapter text relevant to QA pairs to construct dataset, manually scoring Recall@10 and MRR@10 for hundreds of retrieval results, and performing question-by-question error analysis, all of which led him to deeply understand the dataset and common retrieval failure modes. For parameter-efficient finetuning using LLM-Foundry: manually inspecting preprocessed datasets, using a Composer callback to inspect weight types, batch data and loss values during training to ensure that the correct inputs were being passed to the appropriate Flash Attention interface function.

---

**Question:** In his AgentFastbook video, he discovered that his manually created "answer components" were heavily influenced by the available context in the source text. How does this insight affect his strategy for the 'Retrieval' and 'Extraction' phases of the project?

**Answer:** He realized the quality of the LLM-generated answer components (decomposed from the gold standard answer) isn't just about how well they match his own, but how well they perform in the downstream retrieval task.

His new hypothesis is that even if the LLM's components are more granular than his, they might be better for retrieval. The ultimate test of the decomposition's quality will be the quality of the passages it retrieves.

---

**Question:** What is the core hypothesis of his TinyScale Lab project regarding the connection between training dynamics and model capabilities?

**Answer:** That when training dynamics show instability (exploding activations and gradients) model capabilities (grammar, context-tracking, creativity, plot, reasoning, factual knowledge) will deteriorate.

---
**Question:** He's built several custom apps for evaluation. What was the most challenging technical aspect of building the LLM Judge Agreement App with FastHTML?

**Answer:** The most challenging aspect was balancing coding speed with app reliability. The judge agreement app stopped saving comments near the end of his evaluation, leading him to manually copy/paste the comments printed out in the terminal logs. He expects to do at least one more round of full agreement scoring and will continue to evaluate agreement with a sample of LLM judge scores at a regular cadence during training so it will definitely be worth debugging this issue.

---

**Question:** In his debugging of LoRA models, he traced floating point errors back to the difference in matrix operations between merged and un-merged layers. Walk me through how he isolated that issue.

**Answer:** He isolated that issue with a methodical process of elimination, starting broad and progressively narrowing down the problem.

_First, he verified the weights_. he compared the weight matrices of the merged and unmerged LoRA layers and confirmed they were bit-for-bit identical. This ruled out any bugs in the weight-merging logic itself.

_Next, he isolated the LoRA layers_. He checked the outputs of all non-LoRA layers in both models and found they were identical, which proved the discrepancy was happening exclusively within the LoRA layers.

_Then, he pinpointed the forward pass_. The key discovery was that even with identical weights, the output of a single unmerged LoRA layer was different from its merged counterpart. This pointed directly to the forward pass operations as the source of the error.

To confirm this, he used PyTorch's register_forward_hook to log the accumulating error. He saw the mean difference between the two models' outputs grow progressively at each layer, which is evidence of a compounding floating-point error.

The final conclusion was that the unmerged LoRA layer, which performs four separate matrix operations per layer (base_layer, lora_B, lora_B, summation), accumulated more precision errors than the merged layer, which performs only one. This difference, while tiny at each layer, becomes significant across the full depth of the model. He also changed the model dtype to float32 from bfloat16 and found the mean difference between unmerged and merged outputs to decrease in each layer.

---

**Question:** He's done deep dives into both ColBERT and LLM-Foundry. What is a key design choice in one of those libraries that he finds particularly elegant or effective?

**Answer:** For ColBERT, as someone who is GPU-poor, his favorite design choice is its memory-efficient indexing. It encodes passages in batches and deletes the embeddings once they are compressed, which caps the maximum memory usage at 3-5GB whether you're indexing 10k or 10M documents. 

For LLM-Foundry, the most elegant choice is how it enables sequence packing by default, at least for the HuggingFace SmolLM2-135M. The default dataloader passes the `attention_mask` to the model, which correctly triggers `flash_attn_varlen_func` to perform sequence-packed attention calculations, improving training efficiency.

---

**Question:** Based on his experiments with sequence packing, can he explain to a non-expert why simply enabling `BinPackCollator` in LLM-Foundry can lead to context contamination?

**Answer:** Through manual data inspection, he confirmed that LLM-Foundry's `BinPackCollator` packs multiple, separate training samples into a single long sequence.

The problem is that the attention mechanism then treats this as one continuous text. This means tokens from one sample can 'attend to' and learn from tokens from a completely unrelated sample they were packed with. The model learns false relationships across samples that don't exist during real-world inference.

---

**Question:** His "Small-scale proxies" paper summary mentions using tiny models to predict instabilities in large models. How would he design an experiment to test this for a novel architecture?

**Answer:** This would first involve identifying what type of instability the novel architecture experiences. To determine this he would fix all hyperparameters (dataset, number of epochs, optimizer, etc.) except learning rate. He would then perform a learning rate sweep from 3e-4 to 3e-1 and log different artifacts like intermediate layer logits and gradients. He would then analyze the logged data for any exploding or vanishing artifacts.

Suppose that the attention logits explode for a particular large learning rate (as is the case in the paper). He would first document the maximum attention logit for tiny/small models of increasing size (10M, 50M, 100M, 200M, 400M, etc.). Using this data he would fit a line and predict the maximum attention logit for a much larger model size (5B). He would finally train the larger 5B model with the same learning rate and identify the maximum attention logit. If the predicted and actual max attention logit are similar, this is evidence that for this novel architecture small models are indeed proxies for large scale instabilities.

---

**Question:** He's explored full-precision vs. mixed-precision indexing in ColBERT. In a production environment with a tight budget, how would he decide which to use?

**Answer:** His decision would follow a three-step framework: first verify the code, then define the business constraints, and finally test at scale. He found that mixed precision indexing for 70k documents was 2.5 times as slow as full precision indexing, used slightly more GPU memory, slightly less CPU memory, and 0.3% less Recall@10. In a production environment, he would first have a colleague thoroughly check my work: was there a bug in his manual edit of the ColBERT repo? If not, he would consider if indexing speed, GPU memory usage or CPU memory usage were more important. He would also index progressively larger document collections to observe any trends at scale.

---

**Question:** He's identified that building evaluation infrastructure is a critical, often overlooked part of ML projects. How would he pitch the importance of allocating engineering time to a project like your "LM Scoring App" to a leadership team focused on shipping features?

**Answer:** His pitch is that a small investment in custom evaluation tooling will actually help them ship reliable features faster. Using simple frameworks like FastHTML, they can build a custom scoring app in hours, not weeks. This gives their domain experts a targeted way to look at the model's outputs and quickly identify its core failure modes. This tight feedback loop is the fastest way to iterate as their engineers get a precise list of problems to fix. This ensures the feature they ship is not only fast-to-market but also something their users can trust.

---

**Question:** His `fastbook-benchmark` project is an excellent initiative for creating a high-quality evaluation dataset. Walk me through how he would productionize this system. How would he design a data pipeline that continuously and automatically ingests new information, runs his agent to generate question-answer pairs, and versions the dataset, ensuring reproducibility and reliability at 100x the scale?

**Answer:** His approach would be to first make the pipeline robust through incremental scaling using the 12 remaining fastbook chapters, iterating on the pipeline one chapter at a time. For each chapter, the system would use LLMs to generate the dataset items, and he would manually evaluate a large sample if not all of those outputs to identify common failure modes and improve the system accrdingly. This iterative loop of generating, evaluating, and improving the pipeline would harden the system against a wide range of errors. Only after the pipeline is proven robust on the full fastbook dataset would he be confident in scaling it to handle a 100x increase in data, using the same manual inspection-driven iterative approach.

---

**Question:** He has a background in high-stakes compliance and a stated interest in reliable systems. Tell me about the most complex and subtle bug he's encountered in an ML system. How did he methodically diagnose and fix it? What did this experience teach him about building more resilient ML systems from the start?

**Answer:** The most subtle bug he found was when he discovered LLM-Foundry's `BinPackCollator` was causing context contamination across packed sequences.

He diagnosed this methodically. First, he wrote a custom Composer callback to inspect decoded batch input_ids and labels and noticed that each batch item contained multiple sequences delimited by the EOS token, confirming packing was active. To confirm which Flash Attention interface was being used, he monkey-patched two transformers.modeling_flash_utils functions (_upad_input and prepare_fa2_from_position_ids) and confirmed that flash_attn_varlen_func was being used.

BinPackCollator was concatenating multiple sequences, and the attention function was treating it as one long, continuous sequence, allowing tokens from one sample to attend to tokens from another, unrelated sample.

The fix was simple: he stopped using that collator. The experience taught him a critical lesson about building resilient systems: you have to be able to inspect the data at every single stage of the pipeline, from collation to the forward pass. You can't trust that a tool is doing what you think it's doing without verifying it yourself.

**Question:** He's built his own evaluation framework for TinyScaleLab. In a team environment, we often have to decide whether to build a tool internally or use an existing third-party solution. When is it appropriate to build from scratch? Walk me through his decision-making process, using his evaluation framework as an example. What are the long-term maintenance and collaboration costs he'd consider?

**Answer:** His decision-making process for "build vs. buy" centers on one question: is this a unique problem that we want to evaluate with full control, or is it a standardized problem that has already been solved well by others? If it's the former, build your own app, if it's the latter, use an existing app. 

For TinyScaleLab, he wanted to start with flexibility as he figured out whether this was a unique problem, so he chose to write an evaluator app, which took one afternoon. Had he wanted to evaluate his models on established benchmarks he would have chosen an evaluation framework like Inspect AI. The problem he was trying to solve, while complex, was relative small (generating grammatically correct, context-tracking, creative stories that show strong reasoning and factual knowledge capabilities and can hold a good plot) whereas a multi-feature app with thousands of users is a larger problem to wrangle. He could make arguments for both cases: he would recommend building a custom app if you are in early stages of development or if user needs frequently change as you need to iterate quickly with flexible evaluation requirements. If your app is stable and evaluated across more standardized metrics, and if you don't have the capacity to build and maintain an evaluator app, a pre-built solution will work better.

**Question:** In his AgentFastbook project, he's curating a clean, complex dataset. In a real-world product, the data is rarely this clean. Imagine he's tasked with building a RAG system for internal enterprise documents. What are the top three data quality challenges he would anticipate, and what specific strategies and tools would he employ to mitigate them before they impact model performance?

**Answer:** He would anticipate challenges with structure, scope, and scale. His source data (fastbook textbook) is simple structured: explanatory text, some images and code blocks in a Jupyter Notebook. A real-world product might have different data formats to handle. fastbook is narrow in scope: all documents are focused on different aspects of learning machine learning. A real-world product might have different aspects of a more complex domain like law or medicine. fastbook-benchmark is small (191 QA pairs): a real-world product might have thousands or millions of dataset items.

He would address scale and scope with pre-processing the data and adding metadata to the document collection to allow the retrieval/search to identify the appropriate document given a query. He would also perform multi-modal retrieval if applicable as recent research (CLaMR by Wan, et al) shows that multi-modal retrieval outperforms single modality retrieval. Scale would affect both storage/indexing size and time as well as search time. He would implement the recent LightOnAI FastPlaid indexing implementation and AnswerAI's FastKmeans to address speed and/or implement StanfordNLP's ColBERT implementation to address RAM usage. A number of open source implementations (RAGatouille, ColBERT, PyLate) perform search quickly. Finally, mitigating these issues before they impact model performance would require a robust evaluation pipeline. 

---

**Question:** His interest in tiny models and resource-constrained research is fascinating. Let's say we've trained a large, powerful model for a specific task, but it's too slow and expensive for a real-time mobile application. What are the different families of techniques he would consider to create a 'tiny' version of this model? Please discuss the trade-offs between methods like distillation, quantization, and pruning.

**Answer:** While he doesn't have direct experience with all of these, his approach would be to first pursue distillation. Based on what he's heard from experts, it's an underused and powerful solution. He'd distill the logits from the large teacher model into a much smaller, faster student model for the specific task. The potential here is huge; distilling a 100B model to a 1B model is a 100x size reduction.

Next, he'd explore quantization. This can decrease storage and inference time, but it comes with a potential accuracy trade-off. The performance gains are also less dramatic than distillation, perhaps up to an 8x improvement going from 32-bit to 4-bit weights.

He can speak less to pruning, other than its main trade-off is a likely loss in accuracy. Unstructured pruning might not even improve inference speed since you're still performing matrix operations on sparse matrices of the same original size.

Separately, for adapting the model to various downstream tasks efficiently, he would use parameter-efficient finetuning methods like LoRA, DoRA, rsLoRA and so on. This is cheaper than full fine-tuning but doesn't solve the core problem of inference speed for the base model.

---

**Question:** He's implemented many algorithms from scratch in his blog posts. Describe a time he had to work with a large, existing codebase he didn't create. How did he approach understanding the code, and how would he contribute a significant new feature (e.g., adding a new model architecture or data processing module) while adhering to existing design patterns and ensuring he doesn't break anything?

**Answer:** He developed an understanding of the RAGatouille and StanfordNLP/ColBERT libraries by recreating from scratch (using the libraries' internal functions and methods) the indexing and retrieval pipeline. See his RAGatouille/ColBERT Indexing Deep Dive (https://vishalbakshi.github.io/blog/posts/2025-03-12-RAGatouille-ColBERT-Indexing-Deep-Dive/) and Recreating the PLAID ColBERTv2 Scoring Pipeline (https://vishalbakshi.github.io/blog/posts/2024-12-24-PLAID-ColBERTv2-scoring-pipeline/) blog posts. 

When using RAGatouille's `add_index` with a relatively small document collection took 12+ hours. His familiarity with the codebase allowed him to provide a bugfix in RAGatouille where a large dictionary's keys were being generated in each iteration of a list comprehension. He profiled execution time and showed that this list comprehension took 30% of the full indexing time. Removing this bug (storing the dictionary keys once outside the list comprehension) dropped the indexing time for a 200k document collection from 1240 to 900 seconds. You can see his merged PR at https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/RAGatouille/pull/267. He ensured he didn't break anything by testing out the indexing functionality. Additionally, he had two expert researchers review my code (in a Twitter thread!). Jeremy Howard assisted his debugging on Twitter as well.

**Question:** In his TinyScaleLab project, he's pre-training small language models from scratch. The prevailing wisdom is often that bigger is better. What is the core hypothesis he is exploring with this research? What specific, unanswered question about the relationship between training dynamics and model capabilities does he hope to answer?

**Answer:** His core hypothesis is that tiny models are widely underestimated, and that their capabilities are less about raw parameter count and more about being trained on data they can comprehend.

Research like the TinyStories and "Small Language Models are Equation Reasoners" papers showed that small models can exhibit reasoning if the data format is right. HIs own experiments confirmed this: he fine-tuned TinyStories models as small as 1M parameters on the financial_phrasebank sentiment dataset and achieved over 68% accuracy, which is far better than random chance. See his blog post (https://vishalbakshi.github.io/blog/posts/2024-08-22-tinystories-1m-finetune/).

This leads to the specific, unanswered question he hopes to explore with TinyScaleLab: For a stable training process, can a progressive data strategy (moving from simple data like TinyStories to increasingly complex data) unlock unexpectedly strong downstream performance in tiny models? He's trying to find the optimal data mixing strategy that gives him the most capability for the fewest parameters.

---

**Question:** Let's dive deeper into the custom evaluation framework for his TinyScaleLab. What makes it 'custom'? What phenomena can he measure with it that he couldn't with standard benchmarks like GLUE? How does he ensure your evaluation results are statistically significant and not just noise?

**Answer:** It's custom because standard benchmarks like GLUE often test for structured outputs, while he wanted to measure more complex, free-form capabilities like grammar, creativity, plot, reasoning, and context-tracking. His framework is designed to score these dimensions, inspired by the evaluation paradigm in the TinyStories paper. 

To ensure the results were significant and not just noise, he created a rigorous process to align an LLM Judge with his own manual annotations. He started by manually scoring 1350 total LLM judge scores across 18 criteria, and where he found my agreement with the LLM Judge was below 80%, he iterated on the scoring criteria and the prompt itself. This allowed him to focus on the criteria the LLM Judge could reliably score, and as a result, after another round of annotating 1350 scores he achieved 94% alignment between his scores and the judge's, giving him high confidence in the evaluation results.

---

**Question:** He's published deep dives into SOTA libraries like ColBERT. Let's deconstruct it. From first principles, why does a 'bag-of-embeddings' approach like ColBERT's late interaction work so well for retrieval compared to dense vector search from a single CLS token? What are its fundamental limitations, and where does he see the next bottleneck in retrieval algorithms?

**Answer:** From first principles, ColBERT works better because its token-level embeddings capture nuanced differences with more granularity than a single dense vector. Instead of comparing two coarse document-level vectors, ColBERT performs a fine-grained comparison between the query's tokens and the document's tokens using its MaxSim operator (which selects the document token with the highest cosine similarity with a given query token). 

Its two fundamental limitations are storage and the scoring mechanism. First, token-level embeddings, even with compression, have a large storage footprint. Second, MaxSim still relies on cosine similarity, which is theoretically flawed. As stated by Radon's theorem, two very large groups of vectors cannot be linearly separated and cosine similarity (inner product) is a linear operation.

The next bottleneck will be the performance limitations of single-modal retrieval. Recent research like the HyperNetwork and CLaMR papers shows that using tiny neural networks instead of MaxSim or incorporating multi-modality can significantly improve results, respectively, suggesting the future of retrieval is increasingly multi-modal with a complex scoring function.

---

**Question:** His focus on resource-constrained research is timely. Besides pretraining smaller models, what other research areas does he believe are underexplored for creating powerful yet efficient AI? This could be in areas like data efficiency, novel architectures, or learning algorithms. Where would he focus your next research effort and why?

**Answer:** He would focus on three areas that are aligned with his interest in resource-constrained research: distillation, data efficiency, and Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs).

His interest in distillation is motivated by experts who say it's an underutilized but powerful technique for creating smaller, efficient models. For data efficiency, papers like "LIMO: Less is More for Reasoning" show that a small number of high-quality samples can yield state-of-the-art results, signaling that data quality is a promising research direction.

Finally, dLLMs are a fascinating new architecture. Instead of slow, autoregressive generation, they iteratively improve an entire sequence of text at once, resulting in very fast inference.

Of course, any of these research interests would first need to be tied to a new applied AI project once his current AgentFastbook project is complete.

---

**Question:** Research is full of dead ends. Tell me about a hypothesis in his TinyScale Lab or another project that turned out to be wrong. What was the hypothesis, how did his experiments invalidate it, and what did he learn from that null result? How did it change his research direction?

**Answer:** Early in his TinyScaleLab project, he had a simple hypothesis: increasing the training batch size would decrease training time and require fewer epochs to converge. His experiments immediately invalidated this.

He was surprised to find that training time did not consistently decrease, and more importantly, smaller batch sizes often yielded a lower loss for a fixed number of epochs. Unsure of the cause, he shared these findings on Twitter.

Jeremy Howard replied and explained that with a smaller batch size, the model's weights get updated more frequently, which can lead to faster convergence for a fixed number of epochs. Jeremy recommended that Vishal work with the fastai Imagenette dataset to build a better intuition for this relationship.

This null result was incredibly valuable. It showed Vishal he had a gap in my foundational understanding. As a result, he's temporarily pivoted to a new "prerequisite" project on Imagenette, where he's running experiments to deeply understand the interplay between batch size and learning rate. Once he's achieved competitive results with those experiments, he'll return to his TinyScaleLab pretraining with a much stronger intuition.

---

**Question:** Imagine in three years, his line of research into tiny, reliable models is wildly successful. What does that future look like? What new capabilities will be unlocked, and what existing problems will be solved? Paint a picture of the tangible impact his work could have.

**Answer:** If this research is successful, the future it unlocks isn't about one spectacular breakthrough, but about a million "boring" business problems finally getting solved reliably and inexpensively.

It starts with his own work. His AgentFastbook project would no longer need large, expensive models for its pipeline. Instead, a series of tiny, specialized models he's progressively trained would handle text decomposition, retrieval, and extraction with high reliability at a fraction of the cost. This success would serve as a public blueprint for others.

At a larger scale, this blueprint helps lubricate the adoption of AI for small to medium-sized businesses. A company that could never afford to train or serve a massive model can now deploy a small, specialized agent to reliably categorize support tickets, summarize legal documents, or validate invoices. The barrier to entry for practical, valuable AI will have been significantly lowered.

Ultimately, the most important impact is that it empowers the "GPU-poor" individual developers, academics, and researchers with great ideas but limited resources. His work would contribute to a future where a great idea, not access to a massive compute cluster, is the primary requirement for making a tangible contribution to the AI field.

**Question:** He's passionate about making reliable AI systems. Let's ground that in a real product. Imagine he's on a team building an AI-powered coding assistant. Who is the user he's most concerned about failing? Is it the junior developer, the senior architect, the DevOps engineer? How would a "failure" in reliability manifest for that specific user, and how would that inform where he invest your technical efforts?

**Answer:** He would be most concerned about the user who is over-reliant on the coding assistant and is not using their own judgment to steer the development process. It's most likely that the junior developer is this user (due to lack of experience). They may not know what bugs or inefficiences to look out for unless they explicitly throw an error. Common failure modes would be: unecessary/bloated code to handle unlikely edge cases (YAGNI, "you aren't gonna need it"), inefficient patterns (e.g. using a list with redundant values instead of a dictionary with unique keys), and hallucinated API calls and software package names. He would invest in creating evaluation items that directly tested for these failure modes.

---

**Question:** Let's say our team has a fixed budget for the next quarter. We can either invest in a project to improve our flagship model's accuracy by 5% on a key benchmark, or we can invest in a project to create a tiny version of the model that runs on-device, albeit with 10% lower accuracy. As a technical stakeholder, how would he frame the pros and cons of these two paths for a non-technical product leader? What questions would he ask to help the team make the right strategic decision?

**Answer:** He would ask the team: what is the benefit of running the model on device, what is the cost of continuing to serve the larger model, and what is the cost of lowering our users' experience? Let's suppose the flagship model has a 10% error rate. A 10% lower accuracy would increase this to 20%, meaning the users will experience _twice as many errors_. On the flip side, investment in the flagship model decreases the error rate to 5%, meaning the users will experience _half as many errors_. That's a 4x difference in errors experienced. The pro of investing in the flagship model is that even if the effort fails, you don't lose accuracy. The con of investing in the flagship model is that serving the model of that size may not be a sustainable cost for you and thus would bottleneck your user base growth. On the flip side, the pro/con of investing in the tiny version is pushing your serving costs off to the user's device (allowing you to serve more users) but at best doubling their error rate (potentially losing existing users). 

---

**Question:** He's built extensive evaluation frameworks. In a product context, success is more than just academic benchmarks. For his TinyScaleLab project, if he were to turn that into a real product, what would be his 'North Star' metric? It can't be a technical metric like perplexity or accuracy alone. How would he measure whether his tiny models are actually delivering value to users in the real world?

**Answer:** His current TinyScaleLab evals measure abstract capabilities like grammar and reasoning, not direct user value. To productize it, the North Star metric must measure whether the model helps a user achieve their specific goal. Here are two examples:

First, for a simple product like a bedtime story app, the goal is user satisfaction. The North Star metric would be a "Successful Story Score," a combined metric of the model correctly using all user-provided parameters (theme, characters, story length) and a high user-generated rating (e.g., thumbs up/down, comments).

Second, for a more complex product like the `financial_phrasebank` sentiment classification he's experimented with, the user's goal is to make a better investment decision. The North Star metric wouldn't be expert agreement (which is how the dataset was curated), but "Decision Confidence." You could measure this through single-question surveys asking the user, "How much did this sentiment analysis increase your confidence in making an investment decision?"
