**Question:** Explain your "Building Reliable Systems" philosophy. How did your work in data compliance inform this approach?

**Answer:** I have some thought on this thanks to Gemini and will fill this in later. 

---

**Question:** You've mentioned the "Narrow Fence, Long Leash" philosophy. How does your TinyScale Lab project represent a "Long Leash" for your "Narrow Fence" project, AgentFastbook?

**Answer:** Talk about the phased-approach for AgentFastbook and how Imagenette experiments are building me up to phases 2 and 3.

---

**Question:** In your "Finding My Moat" video, you talk about the importance of "boring" tasks. What is the most "boring" but critical part of a project you're building?

**Answer:** TinyScaleLab: manually scoring 450 stories, then manually scoring agreement with 1350 LLM Judge scores, both which allowed me to identify common failure modes and gain confidence in using my LLM Judge. fastbook-benchmark: manually retrieving context from chapter text relevant to QA pairs to construct dataset, manually scoring Recall@10 and MRR@10 for hundreds of retrieval results, and performing question-by-question error analysis, all of which led me to deeply understand the dataset and common retrieval failure modes. Parameter-efficient finetuning using LLM-Foundry: manually inspecting preprocessed datasets, using a Composer callback to inspect weight types, batch data and loss values during training.

---

**Question:** In your AgentFastbook video, you discovered that your manually created "answer components" were heavily influenced by the available context in the source text. How does this insight affect your strategy for the 'Retrieval' and 'Extraction' phases of the project?

**Answer:** After recording the video I realized that my original retrieval process used question text as the query and then used a ColBERT model to retrieve passages relevant to that query. Now my retrieval process will involve the answer component as the query and then use a ColBERT model to retrieve passages relevant to that. I would expect that the retrieval and extraction phases are more tied to the answer component phrasing than I realized during the video. Aligment between my answer component and Haiku components might be more critical than I expected. I may also find that the answer components' granularity is not as important and Haiku's more granular answer components retrieves passages just fine. While my strategy for retrieval and extraction phases hasn't changed, my understanding of the relationship between decomposition and retrieval has improved.

---

**Question:** What was the most surprising failure mode you encountered when evaluating Haiku's text decomposition performance on your fastbook-benchmark?

**Answer:** 

---

**Question:** What is the core hypothesis of your TinyScale Lab project regarding the connection between training dynamics and model capabilities?

**Answer:** That when training dynamics show instability (exploding activations and gradients) model capabilities (grammar, context-tracking, creativity, plot, reasoning, factual knowledge) will deteriorate.

---
**Question:** You built several custom apps for evaluation. What was the most challenging technical aspect of building the LLM Judge Agreement App with FastHTML?

**Answer:** The most challenging aspect was balancing coding speed with app reliability. The judge agreement app stopped saving comments near the end of my evaluation, leading me to manually copy/paste the comments printed out in the terminal logs. I expect to do at least one more round of agreement scoring so this will be an issue that I need to resolve.

**Question:** In your debugging of LoRA models, you traced floating point errors back to the difference in matrix operations between merged and un-merged layers. Walk me through how you isolated that issue.

**Answer:** I isolated that issue with a methodical process of elimination, starting broad and progressively narrowing down the problem.

**First, I verified the weights**. I compared the weight matrices of the merged and unmerged LoRA layers and confirmed they were bit-for-bit identical. This ruled out any bugs in the weight-merging logic itself.

**Next, I isolated the LoRA layers**. I checked the outputs of all non-LoRA layers in both models and found they were identical, which proved the discrepancy was happening exclusively within the LoRA layers.

**Then, I pinpointed the forward pass**. The key discovery was that even with identical weights, the output of a single unmerged LoRA layer was different from its merged counterpart. This pointed directly to the forward pass operations as the source of the error.

To confirm this, I used PyTorch's register_forward_hook to log the accumulating error. I saw the mean difference between the two models' outputs grow progressively at each layer, which is evidence of compounding floating-point error.

The final conclusion was that the unmerged LoRA layer, which performs four separate matrix operations per layer (base_layer, lora_B, lora_B, summation), accumulates more precision errors than the merged layer, which performs only one. This difference, while tiny at each layer, becomes significant across the full depth of the model

**Question:** You've done deep dives into both ColBERT and LLM-Foundry. What is a key design choice in one of those libraries that you find particularly elegant or effective?

**Answer:** For ColBERT, as someone who is GPU-poor, my favorite design choice is its memory-efficient indexing. It encodes passages in batches and deletes the embeddings once they are compressed, which caps the maximum memory usage at 3-5GB whether you're indexing 10k or 10M documents. 

For LLM-Foundry, the most elegant choice is how it enables sequence packing by default for HuggingFace models. The default dataloader passes the `attention_mask` to the model, which correctly triggers `flash_attn_varlen_func` to perform sequence-packed attention calculations, improving training efficiency.

---

**Question:** Based on your experiments with sequence packing, explain to a non-expert why simply enabling `BinPackCollator` in LLM-Foundry can lead to context contamination.

**Answer:** Through manual data inspection, I confirmed that LLM-Foundry's `BinPackCollator` packs multiple, separate training samples into a single long sequence.

The problem is that the attention mechanism then treats this as one continuous text. This means tokens from one sample can 'attend to' and learn from tokens from a completely unrelated sample they were packed with.

It's like reading a single page that's made of sentences from three different books mixed together. The model learns false relationships that don't exist in the real world, which is not ideal as it differs from how the model is used during inference.

---

**Question:** Your "Small-scale proxies" paper summary mentions using tiny models to predict instabilities in large models. How would you design an experiment to test this for a novel architecture?

**Answer:** This would first involve identifying what type of instability the novel architecture experiences. To determine this I would fix all hyperparameters (dataset, number of epochs, optimizer, etc.) except learning rate. I would then perform a learning rate sweep from 3e-4 to 3e-1 and log different artifacts like intermediate layer logits and gradients. I would then analyze the logged data for any exploding or vanishing artifacts.

Suppose that the attention logits explode for a particular large learning rate (as is the case in the paper). I would then document the maximum attention logit for tiny/small models of increasing size (10M, 50M, 100M, 200M, 400M, etc.). Using this data I would fit a line and predict the maximum attention logit for a much larger model size (5B). I would finally train  the larger 5B model with the same learning rate and identify the maximum attention logit. If the predicted and actual max attention logit are similar, we have some evidence that for this novel architecture small models are indeed proxies for large scale instabilities.

**Question:** You've explored full-precision vs. mixed-precision indexing in ColBERT. In a production environment with a tight budget, how would you decide which to use?

**Answer:** My decision would follow a three-step framework: first verify the code, then define the business constraints, and finally test at scale. I found that mixed precision indexing for 70k documents was 2.5 times as slow as full precision indexing, used slightly more GPU memory, slightly less CPU memory, and 0.3% less Recall@10. In a production environment, I would first have a colleague thoroughly check my work---was there a bug in my manual edit of the ColBERT repo? If not, I would consider if indexing speed, GPU memory usage or CPU memory usage were more important. I would also index different and larger document collections to observe any trends at scale.

---

**Question:** You've identified that building evaluation infrastructure is a critical, often overlooked part of ML projects. How would you pitch the importance of allocating engineering time to a project like your "LM Scoring App" to a leadership team focused on shipping features?

**Answer:** My pitch is that a small investment in custom evaluation tooling will actually help us ship reliable features faster. Using simple frameworks like FastHTML, we can build a custom scoring app in hours, not weeks. This gives our domain experts a targeted way to look at the model's outputs and quickly identify its core failure modes. This tight feedback loop is the fastest way to iterate and our engineers get a precise list of problems to fix. This ensures the feature we ship is not only fast to market but also something our users can trust.

---

**Question:** Your `fastbook-benchmark` project is an excellent initiative for creating a high-quality evaluation dataset. Walk me through how you would productionize this system. How would you design a data pipeline that continuously and automatically ingests new information, runs your agent to generate question-answer pairs, and versions the dataset, ensuring reproducibility and reliability at 100x the scale?

**Answer:** I wouldn't scale to 100x immediately. My approach would be to first make the pipeline robust through incremental scaling using the 12 remaining fastbook chapters. I would iterate on the pipeline one chapter at a time. For each chapter, the system would use LLMs to generate the dataset items, and I would manually evaluate a sample of those outputs to identify common failure modes. This iterative loop of generating, evaluating, and improving the pipeline to address things like prompt failures or adding new tools would harden the system against a wide range of errors. Only after the pipeline is proven robust on the full fastbook dataset would I be confident in scaling it to handle a 100x increase in data.

**Question:** You have a background in high-stakes compliance and a stated interest in reliable systems. Tell me about the most complex and subtle bug you've encountered in an ML system. How did you methodically diagnose and fix it? What did this experience teach you about building more resilient ML systems from the start?

**Answer:** The most subtle bug I found was when I discovered LLM-Foundry's `BinPackCollator` was causing context contamination across packed sequences.

I diagnosed this methodically. First, I wrote a custom Composer callback to inspect decoded batch input_ids and labels and noticed that each batch item contained multiple sequences delimited by the EOS token, confirming packing was active. To confirm which Flash Attention interface was being used, I monkey-patched two transformers.modeling_flash_utils functions (_upad_input and prepare_fa2_from_position_ids) and confirmed that flash_attn_varlen_func was being used.

The packer was concatenating separate sequences, and the attention function was treating it as one long, continuous sequence, allowing tokens from one example to attend to tokens from another, unrelated example.

The fix was simple—I stopped using that collator—but the experience taught me a critical lesson about building resilient systems: you have to be able to inspect the data at every single stage of the pipeline, from collation to the forward pass. You can't trust that a tool is doing what you think it's doing without verifying it yourself.

**Question:** You've built your own evaluation framework for TinyScale Lab. In a team environment, we often have to decide whether to build a tool internally or use an existing third-party solution. When is it appropriate to build from scratch? Walk me through your decision-making process, using your evaluation framework as an example. What are the long-term maintenance and collaboration costs you'd consider?

**Answer:** My decision-making process for "build vs. buy" centers on one question: is this a unique problem that we want to evaluate with full control, or is it a standardized problem that has already been solved well by others? For TinyScaleLab, I wanted to start with flexibility as I figure out whether this is a unique problem so I chose to write an evaluator app in an afternoon. However if I wanted to evaluate my models on established benchmarks I would choose an evaluation framework like Inspect AI. Additionally, the problem I'm trying to solve, while complex, is relative small (generating grammatically correct, context-tracking, creative stories that show strong reasoning and factual knowledge capabilities and can hold a good plot) whereas a multi-feature app with thousands of users is a larger problem to wrangle. You could make arguments for both cases: I would recommending building a custom app if we are in early stages of development or if user needs frequently change as we need to iterate quickly with flexible evaluation requirements. If our app is stable and evaluated across more standardized metrics, and if we don't have the capacity to build and maintain an evaluator app, a pre-built solution will work better.

**Question:** In your AgentFastbook project, you're curating a clean, complex dataset. In a real-world product, the data is rarely this clean. Imagine you're tasked with building a RAG system for internal enterprise documents. What are the top three data quality challenges you would anticipate, and what specific strategies and tools would you employ to mitigate them before they impact model performance?

**Answer:** I would anticipate challenges with structure, scope, and scale. My source data (fastbook textbook) is simple structured---explanatory text, some images and code bloks in a Jupyter Notebook. A real-world product might have different data formats to handle. fastbook is narrow in scope---all documents are focused on different aspects of learning machine learning. A real-world product might have different aspects of a more complex domain like law or medicine. I would address scale and scope with pre-processing the data and adding metadata to my document collection to allow the retrieval/search to identify the appropriate document given a query. I would also perform multi-modal retrieval if applicable as recent research (CLaMR by Wan, et al) shows that multi-modal retrieval outperforms single modality retrieval. Scale would affect both storage/indexing size and time as well as search time. I would implement the recent LightOnAI FastPlaid indexing implementation and AnswerAI's FastKmeans to address speed and/or implement StanfordNLP's ColBERT implementation to address RAM usage. A number of open source implementations (RAGatouille, ColBERT, PyLate) perform search quickly. Finally, mitigating these issues before they impact model performance would require a robust evaluation pipeline. While AgentFastbook's scale is much smaller, this is the reason I started the project by setting up a solid set of evals, and a flexible GUI to evaluate.

18. our interest in tiny models and resource-constrained research is fascinating. Let's say we've trained a large, powerful model for a specific task, but it's too slow and expensive for a real-time mobile application. What are the different families of techniques you would consider to create a 'tiny' version of this model? Please discuss the trade-offs between methods like distillation, quantization, and pruning
19. You’ve implemented many algorithms from scratch in your blog posts. Describe a time you had to work with a large, existing codebase you didn't create. How did you approach understanding the code, and how would you contribute a significant new feature (e.g., adding a new model architecture or data processing module) while adhering to existing design patterns and ensuring you don't break anything?
20. In your TinyScale Lab project, you're pre-training small language models from scratch. The prevailing wisdom is often that bigger is better. What is the core hypothesis you are exploring with this research? What specific, unanswered question about the relationship between training dynamics and model capabilities do you hope to answer?
21. Let's dive deeper into the custom evaluation framework for your TinyScale Lab. What makes it 'custom'? What phenomena can you measure with it that you couldn't with standard benchmarks like GLUE or HELM? How do you ensure your evaluation results are statistically significant and not just noise?
22. ou've published deep dives into SOTA libraries like ColBERT. Let's deconstruct it. From first principles, why does a 'bag-of-embeddings' approach like ColBERT's late interaction work so well for retrieval compared to dense vector search from a single CLS token? What are its fundamental limitations, and where do you see the next bottleneck in retrieval algorithms?
23. Your focus on resource-constrained research is timely. Besides pre-training smaller models, what other research areas do you believe are underexplored for creating powerful yet efficient AI? This could be in areas like data efficiency, novel architectures, or learning algorithms. Where would you focus your next research effort and why?
24. Research is full of dead ends. Tell me about a hypothesis in your TinyScale Lab or another project that turned out to be wrong. What was the hypothesis, how did your experiments invalidate it, and what did you learn from that null result? How did it change your research direction?
25. Imagine in three years, your line of research into tiny, reliable models is wildly successful. What does that future look like? What new capabilities will be unlocked, and what existing problems will be solved? Paint a picture of the tangible impact your work could have.
26. You're passionate about making reliable AI systems. Let's ground that in a real product. Imagine you're on a team building an AI-powered coding assistant. Who is the user you're most concerned about failing? Is it the junior developer, the senior architect, the DevOps engineer? How would a 'failure' in reliability manifest for that specific user, and how would that inform where you invest your technical efforts?
27. Let's say our team has a fixed budget for the next quarter. We can either invest in a project to improve our flagship model's accuracy by 5% on a key benchmark, or we can invest in a project to create a 'tiny' version of the model that runs on-device, albeit with 10% lower accuracy. As a technical stakeholder, how would you frame the pros and cons of these two paths for a non-technical product leader? What questions would you ask to help the team make the right strategic decision?
28. You've built extensive evaluation frameworks. In a product context, success is more than just academic benchmarks. For your TinyScale Lab project, if you were to turn that into a real product, what would be your 'North Star' metric? It can't be a technical metric like perplexity or accuracy alone. How would you measure whether your 'tiny models' are actually delivering value to users in the real world?
